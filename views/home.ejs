                    In the co-operative trick-taking game The Crew: The Quest
                    for Planet Nine, the players set out as astronauts on an
                    uncertain space adventure. What about the rumors about the
                    unknown planet about? The eventful journey through space
                    extends over 50 exciting missions. But this game can only be
                    defeated by meeting common individual tasks of each player.
                    In order to meet the varied challenges, communication is
                    essential in the team. But this is more difficult than
                    expected in space. With each mission, the game becomes more
                    difficult. After each mission, the game can be paused and
                    continued later. During each mission, it is not the amount
                    of tricks, but the right tricks at the right time that count.
                    The team completes a mission only if every single player is
                    successful in fulfilling their tasks. The game comes with 50
                    missions, with three additional missions published in
                    spielbox 2/2020.
